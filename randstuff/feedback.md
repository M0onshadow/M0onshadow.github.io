# Feedback of a 9-months volunteering

<br/>

### Context

* * *

 - I spent 9 months in a medico-social structure, located at Hauterives, Drôme, France. It was an adventure for me, at 650km from my house, without knowing anyone or at least the region.

<br/>


### Month-per-month

 - 1st: I was a new recruit, freshly engaged and motivated for a mission in a medico-social structure, supposed to help me develop some new skills. When I started, it was a bit chaotic, all the employees weren’t here, it was the return from a 3-weeks summer camp. Also intimidated by all the work they were doing, I didn’t motivate myself to give a hand at the task. I preferred to observe them working because I learn a lot by doing this.
<br/>

 - 2nd: Kind of stressful due to COV-19 crisis. I spent some time in a village near the structure, or at Grenoble when I have a free day. The environment was hard, some employees were on work stoppage due to personal problems ; another one was thanked and didn’t finish his trial period. It has caused us a tiring feeling. When the 2nd lockdown has been announced, I moved into a friend’s house.
<br/>

 - 3rd: I spent it at a refuge for cats, discovering a lot about this association and their goal. Their name is « Droit de Vivre », and I think they’re doing a beautiful job. I also put in place some other personal projects and tried to relax at the maximum.
<br/>

- 4th: I came back to the structure just before the Christmas holidays. Kind of a rush due to winter camps, a broken tumble dryer, a LOT of suitcases to do (9 + mine), and tons of sheets that just needed a wash. Our superior was already on vacation, how lucky was she. She let us a full list of instructions of what to do before and after the holidays. I left work on December 24th and came back on January 1st. That was hard due to a lot of fatigue. Residents came back on Jan. 3rd, I spent some time continuing residence cleaning.
<br/>

- 5th: Back from the Christmas vacations a bit rushed: a case of COVID-19 detected among the residents of one of the living homes. RT-PCR tests performed by a majority of the community, no one else positive. A little tired and hard to get back into the intense rhythm of volunteering.
<br/>

- 6th & 7th: Months marked by the anxiety of COVID-19 variants. Unfortunately, several cases appeared among the leaders, then at the day workshops, and finally in the residences. 2 positive cases in ours. Evacuation of the negative people to other homes or families, reception of the positive people in mine. Protocol put in place urgently, not much material and/or reused at the very beginning. The fatigue is more and more felt, the anxiety is very present. Several departures to the hospital to be regretted. At the end of the first week, I realize that I have more difficulty breathing through my FFP2 mask than usual, this sign intrigues me, I talk about it to my team leader. Preventive isolation, 3 days later the cutter falls: positive test to the English variant. Isolation for 10 days until the symptoms disappear. Fever, fatigue, coughing, headaches, aches and pains and muscle fatigue.
Total cases: 10 people admitted, including 1 in intensive care + 1 other in hospital for a week; 14 positive staff members.
I returned to my family's home for a week, the time it took to disinfect the entire home. Residual muscular fatigue is felt. Difficulty walking for one to two weeks.
Return of the people in mid-March. A real pleasure to see them again.
<br/>

- 8th: Easter pilgrimage. Quite a tiring ordeal but something very intense emotionally. Strong solidarity and courage of each one which pushes everyone to continue to advance. Presence of the Fraternity* at Easter time, a pleasant and convivial moment.
Many birthdays were celebrated, especially those who had not been able to attend the COVID. Announcement of the home director's pregnancy to the residents.
<br/>

- 9th: Currently ongoing.
