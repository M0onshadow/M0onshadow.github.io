# Feedback of a 9-months volunteering
### Month-per-month

 - 1st: I was a new recruit, freshly engaged and motivated for a mission in a medico-social structure, supposed to help me develop some new skills. When I started, it was a bit chaotic, all the employees weren’t here, it was the return from a 3-weeks summer camp. Also intimidated by all the work they were doing, I didn’t motivate myself to give a hand at the task. I preferred to observe them working because I learn a lot by doing this.


 - 2nd: Kind of stressful due to COV-19 crisis. I spent some time in a village near the structure, or at Grenoble when I have a free day. The environment was hard, some employees were on work stoppage due to personal problems another one was thanked and didn’t finish his trial period. It has caused us a tiring feeling. When the 2nd lockdown has been announced, I moved into a friend’s house.


 - 3rd: I spent it at a refuge for cats, discovering a lot about this association and their goal. Their name is « Droit de Vivre », and I think they’re doing a beautiful job.
I also put in place some other personal projects and tried to relax at the maximum.
